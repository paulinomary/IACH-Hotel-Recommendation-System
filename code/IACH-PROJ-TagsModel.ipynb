      "Reviews for the hotel with the most positive reviews in Paris - Hotel Regina:\n",
      "\n",
      "Review 1: Building is very old but nicely maintained Bed quality was excellent and quality of toilettes are very good We booked family suite and there are three single beds in children room but we have a teenage daughter so they gave us two connecting rooms later which were much better The rooms are facing back of building which is better than facing road because it is more quiet and you can keep window open\n",
      "\n",
      "Review 2: Beautiful hotel in a great location We booked the Eiffel tower junior suite which was lovely with a great view The bed nice and big but very hard I know some prefer hard to soft Good and friendly staff on reception\n",
      "\n",
      "Review 3: THE CITY\n",
      "\n",
      "Review 4: This is my favorite hotel I have stayed here three times and never been disappointed It is located right next to the Louvre and the Tuileries Gardens near a stop on metro line 1 and within easy walking distance of the Paris Opera and the Musee d Orsay The hotel is in an original Haussmann building with decorations in Art Nouveau style An old world Parisian style pervades the building and the excellent service but a recent remodeling has made the rooms and the bathrooms state of the art Many of the rooms have Eiffel Tower views we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Eiffel Tower suite with a table on a small balcony where we could have breakfast overlooking the Eiffel Tower the Louvre and many of the top Paris monuments Hotels in Paris can be expensive and this one is but we left with a feeling of money well spent\n",

      "Review 8: We were lucky to have one of the few rooms with a view of the Eiffel Tower which was wonderful I liked that the windows were double paned and we could open them up for some fresh air and an even better view of the Eiffel Tower The location of this hotel centrally located for any traveler who is wanting to see the main and best highlights of Paris It s right next to the Louvre Museum and the Jardin des Tuileries and other prominent museums The bus and metro lines are very close with quick access to the other sites to see The concierge was helpful the night before we left to get us an early taxi to the airport The bar and terrace looked beautiful but we did not visit them\n",

      "\n",
      "Review 14: The Hotel Regina was in the perfect location to get to all the important sites in Paris The hotel staff was friendly and helpful The old world charm of this historic hotel was just what we wanted Our family room was perfect for us with our 2 children It had lots of room especially for a hotel in Paris and having the 2 fully fitted bathrooms was great Our room faced the Louvre but we had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our small balcony There was no noise from the street below thanks to the double windows The cleaning staff was excellent and our girls loved the turn down service at night The food at the restaurant was good and the bar stayed open late one evening so I could work\n",

      "\n",
      "Review 27: Our room was magnificent a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower Paris Eye and of course all the beauty of Paris The staff were far exceeding even our expectations of a first class hotel They went out of their way to make us feel at home advising us to be sure to try the bar across from the hotel entrance on the corner And their restaurant is filled with staff that is at once unobtrusive yet attentive The service and food must be experienced to understand that without a doubt not a dinner but an epicurean delight of ambience and great food Across the street on the corner is a wonderful Bar Bistro that has scrumptious salads and main dishes that were less expensive than I would have expected for the quantity and quality of the food A must do when staying at the hotel Another tip grab the two day hop on hop off bus pass for around 40 euros and explore all of Paris The pass is far cheaper than trying to get a taxi in some areas My wife loved the shopping so guys wear comfy walking shoes and enjoy the people of Paris\n",
